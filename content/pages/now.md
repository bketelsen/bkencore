## Parenting Child Number Four

Not that I'm not also parenting the rest, but Number Four has [Muenke Syndrome](https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/7097/muenke-syndrome) and all of our spare time has been swallowed by doctor visits, tests, MRI's, CT Scans, multiple surgeries and -- of course -- an adorable baby boy who is the light of my life.

## Cloud Advocacy

I really enjoy doing Cloud Advocacy work at Microsoft. I've been able to 'touch' so many different things, technologies, tools... it's wonderful for my wandering ADHD mind. Coming up on 5 years this summer, which is close to the longest I've ever stayed at one job. The record is CIO/COO for [Clarity Services](https://www.clarityservices.com/), where I led a team that built a consumer credit bureau from scratch.

## Rust & Web Technologies

I lamented in maybe 2017 that the modern web was beyond my grasp. I doubled down learning Javascript and the Node.js ecosystem, and I'm proud to say I'm fairly capable now with basic web development in Next.Js, Svelte, React and more. I pulled that off! Now I'm doing fun work in Rust with Web Assembly. Another challenge -- Never Stop Learning!

## That Florida Life

I still hate Florida, but nearly everybody I love is here. So I'm still here, I guess. It's too hot, too humid, and some of the people are downright scary. Oh yeah, and practically every animal here is interested in killing you.

## Encore API

I'm powering my "Personal API" with [encore](https://encore.dev). _This has really opened up so many possibilites_. I have micro-service style APIs for things like the blog, twitter, my email newsletter, a URL shortener and then some fun composite services that do things like auto-tweet new posts or send email notifications to subscribers of the blog for new articles. I'm just getting started, and I'm expecting that this will evolve rapidly into a really cool hub for all my digital world.
